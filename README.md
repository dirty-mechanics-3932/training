Training
========

When coding always remember:  *DO NO HARM*.  Don't write "temporary code" that interferes with existing code.  Don't use an IO port that's already being used.  Don't use joystick buttons that are already used.  If you MUST do so then do so in a branch and insure you restore the robot to the "last known good" configuration at the end of the day.

Always leave the robot imaged with the most recent good build unless a specific requirement for a different build has been called out and communicated to the team.
